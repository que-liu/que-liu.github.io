title: "GlueTest: Testing Code Translation via Language Interoperability"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/GlueTest
excerpt: 'This paper proposed the idea of testing the translated code using the existing, untranslated tests written in the original programming language. The key to our idea is to leverage language interoperability to run code written in two different languages together. This partial translation approach offers two main benefits: (1) the ability to leverage original tests for validating translated code, not only from the project being translated but also from the clients using this project, and (2) the continuous maintainability and testability of the project during translation.'
