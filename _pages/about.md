Hello! I'm Que Liu, a senior year undergraduate student majoring in Intelligence Science and Technology at University of Shanghai for Science and Technology. My research interest includes robotics, control theory and human-robot interaction.

For detailed information, you can find my CV [here](../assets/CV.pdf).


Experience
======
I am currently a research assistant conducting research in virtual reality and mixed reality advised by [Prof. Diego Gómez-Zará](https://www.dgomezara.cl/) from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.nd.edu/) at [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/). Previously, I was fortunate to participate in the Remote Mini-Crowd Undergraduate Summer Research Program focused on code translation in software engineering supervised by [Prof. Darko Marinov](https://mir.cs.illinois.edu/marinov/) from [Department of Computer Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://www.illinois.edu/).

Research Interest
======
Inspired by [Moravec's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox) and studies in artificial intelligence and control theory, I have developed a strong interest in advancing the foundational theories that empower robots with physical intelligence similar to that of humans. My academic background in these fields has equipped me with a solid understanding of the principles that govern autonomous systems. Additionally, my research in human-computer interaction has provided valuable insight into the importance of human factors in the design of robust robotic systems. These human factors introduce uncertainties that must be carefully addressed to achieve reliable, adaptive control.

With the vision of enabling robots to not only emulate human capabilities but also interact seamlessly with the world around them, I am eager to contribute to the advancement of **control theory**, **robotics**, and **human-robot interaction**. I am excited about the opportunity to explore how these interdisciplinary fields can work together to create more intelligent and adaptive systems.


Miscellaneous
------
Outside the academics, I enjoy photography, filming, and staying active through gym workouts and long-distance running.

As a first-generation college student, I am deeply grateful for the support and guidance I have received throughout my academic journey. Motivated by this experience, I am committed to contributing to a more inclusive and equitable academic community—one where individuals are valued for their abilities and potential, regardless of background, race, or beliefs.
